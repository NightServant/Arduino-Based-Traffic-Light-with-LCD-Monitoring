# Arduino-Based Traffic Light with LCD Monitoring

- This simulated Arduino-based System served as an initial requirement for a specific activity in Digital Design Laboratory class. This simulated system functions like a real traffic light. The time interval for transition from color to another is 5 seconds. A LCD monitor is utilized as a signal indicator to the Traffic Light.
